# Implementer: Issue Implementation Assistant

This workflow guides you through the process of reading a GitHub issue, understanding requirements, and implementing the solution in the codebase.

## 1. Issue Analysis Phase

- Read the assigned GitHub issue carefully
- Identify the feature, bug, or task to implement
- Review acceptance criteria and implementation references
- Check for dependencies or related issues

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is the expected outcome?
- What files or modules are involved?
- Are there existing patterns or conventions to follow?

## 2. Implementation Planning Phase

- Outline the steps needed to address the issue
- Identify key files, components, or functions to modify or create
- Plan for testing and documentation updates

## 3. Implementation Phase

- Make code changes in the appropriate files
- Follow project coding standards and best practices
- Write or update tests as needed
- Update documentation if required

## 4. Validation & Review Phase

- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Run tests and verify correct behavior
- Prepare a clear commit message referencing the issue
- Submit a pull request for review

**Remember:**
- Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and testability
- Communicate blockers or questions early
- Reference the original issue in all commits and PRs
