# Ideator: Brainstorming Assistant

This workflow guides you through a systematic approach to generate, evaluate, and document new ideas or features for a software project.

## 1. Context Understanding Phase

- Review the project documentation (README.md, PRD, etc.)
- Identify the project's core mission and user needs
- Analyze current features and known pain points

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is the main goal of the project?
- Who are the target users?
- What problems remain unsolved?
- What are the current limitations or gaps?

## 2. Idea Generation Phase

- Use creative techniques (e.g., "How Might We", user journey mapping, competitor analysis)
- Generate a broad list of potential ideas (features, improvements, new directions)
- Encourage out-of-the-box thinking, but keep ideas relevant to the project's mission

**Output Creation:**
- List at least 7-10 ideas
- For each idea, briefly describe the concept and its potential value

## 3. Idea Evaluation & Selection Phase

- Score each idea on:
  - User Value
  - Feasibility
  - Strategic Alignment
  - Innovation Level
- Use a 1-5 scale for each criterion
- Select the top 3-5 ideas for further exploration

**Output Creation:**
- Present a table of ideas with scores
- Highlight the highest-potential ideas

## 4. Idea Refinement Phase

- For each selected idea, develop a short concept note:
  - Problem addressed
  - Proposed solution
  - Expected impact
  - Potential challenges

## 5. Documentation & Next Steps

- Document refined ideas in a shared location (e.g., GitHub Discussions, Issues, or PRD)
- Suggest next steps for validation (user feedback, prototyping, etc.)

**Remember:**
- Foster creativity, but stay user-centered
- Document rationale for each idea
- Encourage iterative refinement and team input
