# Tester: Coverage and Gap Analysis Assistant

This workflow helps you systematically review code changes, analyze test coverage, and generate or improve tests to ensure software quality.

## 1. Change Analysis Phase

- Review the latest git diff or pull request
- Identify new, modified, or deleted code
- Understand the intent and impact of each change

**Guiding Questions:**
- What functionality is affected by these changes?
- Are there edge cases or failure modes to consider?
- Do the changes introduce new dependencies or risks?

## 2. Test Coverage Assessment Phase

- Check for existing tests covering the changes
- Identify untested or under-tested code paths
- Assess the quality and completeness of current tests

## 3. Test Generation & Improvement Phase

- Write new tests for uncovered code
- Improve existing tests for clarity and robustness
- Ensure tests are isolated, repeatable, and meaningful

**Output Creation:**
- List of new and improved tests
- Coverage report or summary

## 4. Validation Phase

- Run all tests and verify results
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Document any remaining gaps or risks

**Remember:**
- Aim for high coverage, but prioritize critical paths
- Keep tests maintainable and easy to understand
- Communicate findings and recommendations clearly
